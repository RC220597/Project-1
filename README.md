# A History of World War Two #

## A fully functional and responsive website to educate users about World War Two ##

A History of World War Two is a online hub that was built to educate and interest users about the history of World War Two. This website is targeted to and intended for people researching things around this topic for research and educational purposes as well as individuals with interests in this particular topic. Inside this I have used several different elements of HTML and CSS to do the following:

* Create a user friendly interface to make obtaining information easy
* Style the website to create a good user experience 
* Include different elements to further assist with learning of the topic
* Include external links that dont disturb the original website

  ## Testing ##

  __HTML Testing__

  - Upon completion and running my source code through the HTML Validator I found two errors present which were directed towards the <iframe> property of my embedded videos on the gallery.html, the error was present due to these tages having a frameborder attribute which was obsolete. After discovering this error I edited the gallery.html, re ran the source code for all HTML files through the validator and recieved a pass with no errors present.
