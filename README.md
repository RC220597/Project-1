# A History of World War Two #

## A fully functional and responsive website to educate users about World War Two ##

A History of World War Two is a online hub that was built to educate and interest users about the history of World War Two. This website is targeted to and intended for people researching things around this topic for research and educational purposes as well as individuals with interests in this particular topic. Inside this I have used several different elements of HTML and CSS to do the following:

* Create a user friendly interface to make obtaining information easy
* Style the website to create a good user experience 
* Include different elements to further assist with learning of the topic
* Include external links that dont disturb the original website
